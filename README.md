# PythonETLPipelineProjects

This repository showcases Python projects and DataCamp course progress on ETL/ELT data pipelines, designed for learning data engineering with Python.

## Contents
- **Courses**: ETL and ELT in Python, Data Warehousing Concepts  
- **Project**: Data Pipeline ETL with Python

## Why This Repository?
This repo is designed to be a practical resource for:
- Aspiring data engineers looking to master ETL/ELT pipelines.
- Developers seeking Python-based data pipeline examples.
- Learners interested in data warehousing and Kimball/Inmon methodologies.

## DataCamp Courses
1- **ETL and ELT in Python**
- Learned to build performant data pipelines using Python libraries (e.g., pandas, json).
- Covered extraction from structured/unstructured sources, transformation techniques, and loading data into target systems.
- Explored pipeline validation, unit testing, and monitoring for reliability.

2- **Data Warehousing Concepts**
- Studied data warehouses, data marts, and data lakes.
- Compared Bill Inmon's top-down and Ralph Kimball's bottom-up approaches.
- Mastered Kimball's four-step data modeling process and handling slowly changing dimensions.
- Understood differences between OLAP and OLTP systems.
